# {{ title }}

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is an excellent Markdown PKM which works off local files. I transitioned to it from Evernote and haven't looked back.

One of the best things about it is that it's super easy to customise if you know a bit of Javascript. These are the plugins I've written for it:

| Plugins |   |
|---------|---|
| [Share Note](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-share) | Share an encrypted copy of a note |
| [Google Photos](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-google-photos) | Adds Google Photos integration 
| [Image Captions](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-image-captions) | Adds captions to images |
| [Updated modified date](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-frontmatter-modified-date) | Automatically update a frontmatter `modified` field when you edit a note |

You can find me as [AlanG](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/alang/summary) on the Obsidian forums.
